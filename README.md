# iOS 16 on the Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F, Exynos 8890) — `herolte` branch

**Status, 2026-11-07:** Apple's XNU kernel boots on a flat Galaxy S7 and runs the
unmodified **iPhone X iOS 16.7.16 userland** to the home screen with **GPU
acceleration**, **Wi-Fi** and **sound**: CoreAnimation renders on the Mali-T880
through OpenGL ES (Mesa Panfrost under HakiOS's EAGL bridge), the BCM4359 joins
WPA2 networks, and the loudspeaker plays. Apps open and load, and it is usable
day to day apart from the gaps below. There is no Metal.

**Try it:** [docs/herolte-howto.md](docs/herolte-howto.md). Apple's software and
the Wi-Fi firmware are not in this repository: you build the iOS root from
Apple's IPSW in a private repository and take the firmware from your own phone.

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Boot | Samsung S-Boot loads our loader from BOOT (`shim/herolte/`), which starts XNU |
| CPU | All 8 cores, Mongoose at 2288 MHz (Samsung's own voltage table). UI threads move from the A53s to an idle Mongoose (0274, 0321). No thermal limit yet |
| RAM | About 3 GiB: the second DRAM bank (2 GiB) plus the first bank's free pieces (0326-0329, `tools/herolte-adt-ram-banks.py`) |
| Storage | Own Exynos UFS driver; iOS root is HFSX in USERDATA, read/write, with the system apps |
| GPU | Mali-T880 MP12 at 650 MHz through EAGL → OSMesa/Panfrost → our kernel job service |
| Display | iOS draws an iPhone 8 screen, 750×1334 @2x, scaled to the 1440×2560 panel by the GPU into two buffers flipped on the display's IDMA (0322: no tearing). Panel at a real 60 Hz (0296); CoreAnimation told 120 Hz and the kernel's timer coalescing off (0323) |
| Wi-Fi | BCM4359 over PCIe with the phone's own firmware, WPA2 handshake in the kernel, `en0` and Apple80211 for wifid: the Wi-Fi icon, internet, Safari (0308-0315) |
| Sound | The loudspeaker through the I2S block and an AudioServerPlugIn (`gpu/hakios-audio`, `heroaudio=3`) |
| Navigation | Physical Home button (`home-button-type` 1). Home gestures need type 2, which brings UIKit's red rdar:45025538 status bar at this size; not solved |
| Wallpaper | iOS's own wallpapers and gallery, except the stock iOS 16 one (black) |
| Touch, buttons, battery | Working |
| Not working | modem, Bluetooth, camera, sensors, sleep, Face ID, Metal (the Today view and Control Center blurs are black), Siri's voices |

[danstronics/ios-s9plus-exynos](https://github.com/danstronics/ios-s9plus-exynos) (Galaxy S9/S9+):
the display flip, the CoreAnimation timing, the UI-thread migration and the RAM banks follow their work.

What made it usable, in the order found: factory GPU and CPU rates at factory
voltages, the apps in the root image, moving `BTAudioHALPlugin` away (it kept
asking the absent bluetoothd; idle CPU fell from over 300% to under 25% of 800%,
found by [syncmodz/ios-s9](https://github.com/syncmodz/ios-s9)), and the lower
resolution. Boot arguments and how to build the ADT: `tools/mkadt_herolte.py --iphone8`
and [HEROLTE_PROGRESS.md](HEROLTE_PROGRESS.md) (Spanish).

How to try it: [docs/herolte-howto.md](docs/herolte-howto.md) (erases USERDATA;
Apple's software is not in this repository). The S7 kernel patches are
`xnu/patches/0200` and up; the board config is `MACHINE_CONFIG=HEROLTE`.

Next: thermal limit, audio, Wi-Fi, more optimization. Help is welcome. Please
open an issue with the log from `tools/herolte-log-pull.py` and a photo of the screen.

# ios-a5xelte (SM-A510F experimental port)

This fork targets the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016), `a5xelte` / Exynos7580. The original `ios-sweet` README remains below as a **donor reference**. Its iOS home-screen claim, Xiaomi boot commands, 16 KiB pages, UFS root, Qualcomm drivers and `userdata` flashing instructions do **not** describe the Samsung port.

**A5XELTE status, 2026-10-20:** A 4 KiB, A5XELTE-configured XNU 8796 kernel enters on the physical SM-A510F. The Samsung BOOT loader hands off the firmware display through Exynos7580 DECON/DSIM. The user has verified XNU-owned assembly text and dynamic C/`kprintf` output through VM bootstrap, CPU0 self-IPI, pthread registration, scheduled network workers and passing Skywalk self-tests. An 8 MiB HFS+ RAM disk was mounted earlier. The new Exynos7580 read-only eMMC driver identifies GPT `SYSTEM` p20 as `/dev/emmcroot0`; the phone screen confirms `BSD root: emmcroot0` and `hfs: mounted A5XNU on device b(1, 0)`. The A5XELTE unsigned-root exception passes the next check, and XNU attempts process 1. The HFS volume is empty, so `/sbin/launchd` is missing and iOS userland is not running.

The A5XELTE path uses `shim/a5xelte/`, `tools/mkadt_a5xelte.py`, `tools/a5xelte-pack-probe.py` and XNU patches `0082` onward. BOOT p10 carries the test XNU; the user also explicitly authorized replacing Linux SYSTEM p20 with a dedicated HFS+ root. Recovery p11, EFS p3 and USERDATA p23 are preserved. Device and build evidence is in [A5XELTE_PROGRESS.md](A5XELTE_PROGRESS.md), with technical setup in [docs/a5xelte-bringup.md](docs/a5xelte-bringup.md). [docs/a5xelte-migration-map.md](docs/a5xelte-migration-map.md) tracks which donor components can be reused and when SWEET-specific code can be retired.

## Original ios-sweet README (donor reference)

# ios-sweet

**Apple's iOS 16 running on a Redmi Note 10 Pro.**

This project ports Apple's open-source XNU kernel (xnu-8796, the iOS 16 generation) to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro (`sweet`, Qualcomm SM7150 / Snapdragon 732G). On top of it runs the **unmodified iOS 16.7.16 (20H392) userland of the iPhone X**: launchd, the system daemons, backboardd, SpringBoard and the stock apps.

As of **2026-10-18** the phone boots to the **iOS home screen**. You can unlock it, open Settings, pull down Control Center and the notification center, and use the touchscreen and the hardware buttons. Rendering runs entirely on the CPU; there is no GPU driver.

> Experimental bring-up, not a usable phone OS. Many things are missing or stubbed (see below), and Apple's security model is mostly switched off. It installs into the `userdata` partition and so **erases Android's user data**.

## What works

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Boot | Stock Xiaomi bootloader → `fastboot boot` of our shim → XNU. Nothing is flashed to the boot partitions |
| CPU | 6 of the 8 cores (the six Cortex-A55s) via PSCI, 16K pages, GICv3 interrupts, timers |
| Memory | About 3.95 GiB of the upper DDR bank |
| Storage | Own UFS host driver; the iOS root is a journaled HFS+ volume in `userdata`, read/write |
| iOS userland | Real iPhone X 16.7.16 root filesystem and shared cache; launchd and the system daemons run |
| Display | Kernel IOSurface + IOMobileFramebuffer (`AppleCLCD`) services; CoreAnimation renders in software; frames are copied into the bootloader's framebuffer. Presented to iOS as an iPhone X panel (1125×2436) |
| GUI | backboardd, SpringBoard, lock screen, home screen, Control Center, notification center, Settings |
| Touch | Goodix GT9896 over I²C (GENI), rail enabled through RPMh, delivered as HID digitizer events |
| Buttons | Power, volume up/down (PMIC through SPMI) as HID consumer keys; lock/wake works |
| Battery | IOPMPowerSource service (static 100 %, charging icon; real fuel-gauge readout prepared) |
| Device identity | iPhone X (`iPhone10,3` / `D22AP`): no Home button, gesture UI |
| Activation | Native "Hactivation" path of mobileactivationd, chosen through device-tree security status. No Apple servers involved |

## What does not work (yet)

- **Navigation:** you cannot leave an app (the home gesture and AssistiveTouch Home do nothing yet).
- **No Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, audio, camera, sensors, GPS or SEP / Face ID.** Daemons for them start and fail or keep relaunching.
- **No GPU.** Everything is drawn by the CPU at roughly 20–30 fps. The two Cortex-A76 cores are not used yet.
- **Few apps.** The image has only what is on the system volume. There is no App Store, no Apple ID, and some Settings pages are empty.
- **Slow boot:** about 4 minutes on the Apple logo.
- **Security is off:** permissive code signing (AMFI) and sandbox policies, a stub AppleKeyStore, no data protection. Do not put anything personal on it.

## How it boots

```
ABL (stock Xiaomi bootloader, unlocked)
  -> fastboot boot shim-boot.img              (temporary; nothing is flashed to boot)
     -> shim: own MMU setup, reads the live FDT, loads the payload from the ramdisk
        -> XNU Mach-O + generated Apple Device Tree (ADT) + boot-args
           -> XNU -> UFS driver -> HFS+ root in the userdata partition
              -> dyld + shared cache -> launchd -> daemons -> backboardd + SpringBoard
```

There is no serial port (the debug UART is wired as SPI on this board). The kernel draws its console into the framebuffer that ABL leaves at `0x9c000000`, and keeps a persistent 4 MiB log ring at the end of `userdata`. You read that log from OrangeFox recovery with `tools/sweet-log-pull.sh`, so you don't have to film the screen.

## How to do it yourself

You need a Redmi Note 10 Pro (`sweet`, global or Indian variant, SM7150) with an **unlocked bootloader**, a Linux PC, and a GitHub account for the kernel build. This is the exact path used for the screenshots above; other variants or firmware may need changes. **Everything on `userdata` is lost.** Bootloaders, recovery, modem and persist partitions are never touched.

### 0. Back up the phone

Boot OrangeFox (or any recovery with adb root) temporarily and pull at least `persist`, `modemst1`, `modemst2`, `fsg`, `fsc` and `boot`, `dtbo`, `vbmeta`. They contain per-device calibration data. Keep them off git; `.gitignore` already excludes `backup/`, `dtb/` and `recovery/`.

The shim needs the stock DTB. Unpack your phone's stock `boot.img`:

```sh
python3 tools/unpack_bootv2.py backup/boot.img dtb/boot_unpacked   # -> dtb/boot_unpacked/dtb
```

### 1. Build the kernel

The kernel builds on GitHub's macOS runners with [blacktop/darwin-xnu-build](https://github.com/blacktop/darwin-xnu-build). The workflow fetches xnu-8796, applies `xnu/patches/` in order, and also stages the pinned open-source libpthread, HFS and BearSSL sources it needs. Fork the repo (public repos get free macOS minutes) and run:

```sh
gh workflow run xnu.yml -R YOU/ios-sweet
gh run download RUN_ID -R YOU/ios-sweet -n xnu-kernel -D xnu/out
```

To check a patch locally before spending a CI run, `tools/xnu-cc.py` replays the compile commands of a previous CI log for single files.

### 2. Build the iOS root image

Download the iPhone X (iPhone10,3) iOS 16.7.16 (20H392) IPSW from Apple. Then, on Linux, with `apfs-fuse`, `hfsprogs` and sudo:

```sh
# OS, SystemOS and AppOS disk images from the IPSW (see BuildManifest.plist for their names)
tools/mkiosroot.sh OS.dmg SystemOS.dmg AppOS.dmg ios16-root.img 16G
sudo fsck.hfsplus -fy ios16-root.img
sudo mount -t hfsplus -o loop,force ios16-root.img /mnt/iosroot
sudo python3 tools/sweet-root-tweaks.py /mnt/iosroot
sudo umount /mnt/iosroot
img2simg ios16-root.img ios16-root.simg
```

`mkiosroot.sh` copies the OS volume and both cryptexes into one case-sensitive journaled HFS+ volume. It adds the dyld cache links, the plain system keybag and the log directories the daemons expect. `sweet-root-tweaks.py` applies the bring-up changes: it skips Setup, seeds the activation state, removes the baseband daemon, disables the watchdogs that kill slow apps and the crash-looping media paths, and so on. The script's header explains each change.

The device tree builder copies `/product` from the real iPhone X device tree, which MobileGestalt needs. Extract it once, without downloading the whole IPSW:

```sh
python3 tools/remotezip.py IPSW_URL DeviceTree.d22ap.im4p research/ipsw-x/dt
ipsw img4 im4p extract research/ipsw-x/dt/Firmware/all_flash/DeviceTree.d22ap.im4p -o research/ipsw-x/d22ap.adt
```

### 3. Build the boot image

Needs `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` and `mkbootimg`.

```sh
python3 tools/mkadt.py shim/out/sweet.adt --highmem
python3 tools/mkpayload.py xnu/out/kernel.development.sweet shim/out/sweet.adt shim/out/payload.bin \
    --cmdline 'debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=6 keepsyms=1 -enable_kprintf_spam -noprogress rd=ufsroot0 unentitled_ios_sim_launch=1 ignition_level=1 wdt_test=no_user_checkin ufsrw=1 rootrw=1 launchd_unsecure_cache=1 wdt=-1 sweetfb_noconsole=1 sweetfb_hz=30'
shim/build.sh ../shim/out/payload.bin      # -> shim/out/shim-boot.img
```

What the less obvious boot-args do:

| Boot-arg | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `rd=ufsroot0 ufsrw=1 rootrw=1` | Root on the `userdata` partition, writable |
| `cpus=6` | Start the six A55 cores; `cpus=1` is the safe fallback |
| `launchd_unsecure_cache=1` | launchd accepts its job cache without AMFI |
| `wdt=-1 wdt_test=no_user_checkin` | No hardware watchdog |
| `sweetfb_noconsole=1` | Stop drawing kernel text over the GUI. It still goes to the persistent log; panics are drawn |
| `sweetfb_hz=30` | Panel refresh rate of the CPU copy |
| `sweettouch=0`, `sweetkeys=0` | Disable the touch or button driver |

### 4. Flash the root and boot

```sh
fastboot -S 512M flash userdata ios16-root.simg   # ~7 minutes; do not unplug
# Xiaomi's fastboot often hangs after a large flash: re-enter fastboot with Power + Volume down
fastboot boot shim/out/shim-boot.img
```

The first boot takes about 4–5 minutes on the Apple logo, then the lock screen appears. Swipe up to unlock. To get back to fastboot, hold Power + Volume down.

### 5. Read the kernel log

```sh
fastboot boot recovery/recovery.img        # OrangeFox, temporary
tools/sweet-log-pull.sh logs/boot.txt      # 4 MiB console ring from the end of userdata
adb reboot bootloader
```

The log contains crash reports with backtraces (`CRASH name ...`), IOKit traces of backboardd and SpringBoard, and the drivers' `SWEET ...` lines. `tools/sweet-crash.py` symbolicates them against the shared cache.

### QEMU

`tools/qemu-sweet.py` boots the same kernel on QEMU `virt` with a test RAM-disk root. It is useful for kernel-only changes; see `NOTES.md`.

## Key hardware facts

- RAM: payloads use the upper bank, `0x100000000` + `0xfcc00000` (about 3.95 GiB), above Qualcomm's protected carve-outs.
- GICv3 with security extensions: the timer goes through Group 1 IRQ (virtual timer INTID 19), not FIQ as on Apple silicon.
- PSCI through `smc`, 19.2 MHz timer, ARMv8.2 without pointer authentication. MPIDR uses Aff1 for the core number.
- Panel: 1080×2400 DSC video mode, continuous splash from ABL, no refresh kick needed.
- Touch: Goodix GT9896 at I²C `0x5d` on QUP SE7 (`0xa84000`), powered by PM6150L LDO11 through RPMh.
- Buttons: power and volume down on the PM6150 PON block, volume up on PM6150L GPIO2 (SPMI SID 4).
